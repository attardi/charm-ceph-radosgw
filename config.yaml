      Optional configuration to support use of additional sources such as:

        - ppa:myteam/ppa
        - cloud:trusty-proposed/kilo
        - http://my.archive.com/ubuntu main

      The last option should be used in conjunction with the key configuration
      option.

      Note that a minimum ceph version of 0.48.2 is required for use with this
      charm which is NOT provided by the packages in the main Ubuntu archive
      for precise but is provided in the Ubuntu cloud archive.
  key:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Key ID to import to the apt keyring to support use with arbitary source
      configuration from outside of Launchpad archives or PPA's.

  use-syslog:

      If set to True, supporting services will log to syslog.
  use-ceph-optimised-packages:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: |
      By default apache2 and libapache2-mod-fastcgi will be installed from the
      Ubuntu archives. This option allows for an alternate ceph.com install
      source which contains patched versions with added support for HTTP
      100-continue. See the following page for more info:

      http://ceph.com/docs/dumpling/radosgw/manual-install/#continue-support
  use-embedded-webserver:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: |
      Newer versions of the Ceph RADOS Gateway support use of an embedded web
      container instead of Apache + mod-fastcgi, avoiding some of the nuances
      of using the stock mod-fastcgi packages from Ubuntu.

      Enable this option to disable use of Apache and enable the embedded
      web container feature.
  vip:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Virtual IP(s) to use to front API services in HA configuration.

      If multiple networks are being used, a VIP should be provided for each
      network, separated by spaces.
  ha-bindiface:
    type: string
    default: eth0
    description: |
      Default network interface on which HA cluster will bind to communication
      with the other members of the HA Cluster.
  ha-mcastport:
    type: int
    default: 5414
    description: |
      Default multicast port number that will be used to communicate between
      HA Cluster nodes.
  os-public-hostname:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The hostname or address of the public endpoints created for ceph-radosgw
      in the keystone identity provider.

      This value will be used for public endpoints. For example, an
      os-public-hostname set to 'files.example.com' with will create
      the following public endpoint for the ceph-radosgw:

      https://files.example.com:80/swift/v1
  ceph-osd-replication-count:
    type: int
    default: 3
    description: |
      This value dictates the number of replicas ceph must make of any object
      it stores within RGW pools. Note that once the RGW pools have been
      created, changing this value will not have any effect (although it can be
      changed in ceph by manually configuring your ceph cluster).
  rgw-lightweight-pool-pg-num:
    type: int
    default: 64
    description: |
      When the Rados Gatway is installed it, by default, creates pools with
      pg_num 8 which, in the majority of cases is suboptimal. A few rgw pools
      tend to carry more data than others e.g. .rgw.buckets tends to be larger
      than most. So, for pools with greater requirements than others the charm
      will apply the optimal value i.e. corresponding to the number of OSDs
      up+in the cluster at the time the pool is created. For others it will use
      this value which can be altered depending on how big you cluster is. Note
      that once a pool has been created, changes to this setting will be
      ignored.
